## Simple AngularJS Scope Inspector for Firebug

This is a simple Firebug extention that allows you to inspect the AngularJS scope that a DOM element binds to.

__Usage:__

Simply right-click on an element and select "Inspect Angular Scope" from the context menu. 
If want more fine-grained selection of elements, you can use it from inside Firebug, e.g. from the HTML panel.
Basically, any DOM element - be it in the HTML panel, DOM panel breadcrumb, logged in the console etc - that binds to 
an Angular JS scope, has a "Inspect Angular Scope" context menu item.

__Requirements:__

Firebug and an AngularJS-based page.

__Tested on:__

Firefox 24 + Firebug 1.11.1

__Warranties:__

None. Use it on you own risk :)
